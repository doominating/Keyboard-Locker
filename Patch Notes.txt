	Changed labeling for profile keys
	Made profile keys renameable
	Added quick unlock all key feature when you left click on the profile name above keyboard when selected

Version 1.3 - TheTrueSneak
	Added two seperate Menus in the about section.  One for the program to show Keybinds When developed the other for information about the program and the development.
		With information on how to contact us about improvement ideas.
	Made every profile button pressable and where you can change the name. Need to make it to where when one is highlighted then the others are not.
	Made the Lock All Keys button functionable.  Made a Unlock All button. Have yet to map it. Trying to combine an "or" function for that button so we dont have another
		85 lines of code for one button.
	
Version 1.4 TheTrueSneak
	Both the Lock All button and the Unlock all Button work.  Mapped out shortbut keys to lock and unlock all keys.  Still having an issue with the Unlock function
		working while all the keys are locked.
