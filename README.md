Keyboard Locking Program Ver 1.7


If you would just like the .exe without any of the program development portions you can go into the bin/DEBUG folder and download the
KeyboardLocker.exe file and run it.  You dont need any install or supporting infrastructure so far the program has been tested on
Windows 7, 8, 10 and is compatible with the touchscreen. Locking the enter on the NumPad will also disable the Enter function from the 
keyboard and vice versa.  If you have locked all keys and are in a Fullscreen application i.e. a movie you will have to press Ctl+Alt+Del
to get out of the fullscreen application/software and then unlock all of your keys again. If you have any tips or tricks to make the program
more versatile please let me know.
